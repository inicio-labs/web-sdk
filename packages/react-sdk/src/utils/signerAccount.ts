/**
 * Initializes an account from signer configuration.
 *
 * This function:
 * 1. Syncs the client state
 * 2. Builds an account with the signer's public key commitment as the auth component
 * 3. Attempts to import from chain if public/network storage mode
 * 4. Creates the account locally if it doesn't exist
 *
 * When `importAccountId` is set on the config, steps 2-4 are skipped entirely
 * and the account is imported from the chain by ID. This is the fast path for
 * wallets that create accounts externally (e.g., via a vault with HD key
 * derivation) and already know the on-chain account ID.
 *
 * Why import is needed even though the signer "owns" the account: with an
 * external signer the keys live in the vault, not in this client's store, and
 * the store is per-device — on a fresh device/browser it has no record of the
 * account even though the signer can sign for it. `syncState()` only refreshes
 * accounts the store already tracks; it does not discover an account by ID. So
 * `importAccountById` is how an untracked-but-externally-owned account gets
 * registered locally. The slow path doesn't need it because it rebuilds the
 * account from the public-key commitment + seed and tracks it via `newAccount`;
 * the fast path is for signers (e.g. MidenFi) that hand over only the ID and
 * cannot reconstruct those creation parameters.
 *
 * @param client - The WebClient instance
 * @param config - The signer account configuration
 * @returns The account ID as a string
