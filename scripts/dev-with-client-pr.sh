# Local-dev mirror of .github/actions/inject-linked-client-pr.
#
# Appends a [patch] block to Cargo.toml that retargets miden-client (and
# miden-client-sqlite-store) at a linked miden-client PR's head branch,
# wrapped in begin/end markers so it can be removed cleanly with --clear.
# A pre-commit hook (lefthook.yml) blocks committing while the marked
# block is present, so you can't accidentally ship the patch.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh                # auto-detect: read 'Client PR: #N' from current branch's PR body
#   scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh 1234           # use miden-client#1234
#   scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh 0xMiden/miden-client#1234   # explicit cross-repo form
#   scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh --clear        # remove the patch block + restore Cargo.lock
#
# Requirements: gh (for PR lookup), cargo, awk.
