# CLAUDE.md — repo notes for AI agents

Conventions and tooling notes for `0xMiden/web-sdk`. End-user docs live in [README.md](README.md); per-package usage guides live alongside the packages (e.g. [`packages/react-sdk/CLAUDE.md`](packages/react-sdk/CLAUDE.md)).

## What this repo is

A pnpm monorepo holding the JS / WASM / React bits previously part of [`0xMiden/miden-client`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client). Five published artifacts:

| Artifact | Path | Registry |
|---|---|---|
| `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` | `crates/web-client/` (Rust + WASM + JS bindings) | npm |
| `@miden-sdk/react` | `packages/react-sdk/` | npm |
| `@miden-sdk/vite-plugin` | `packages/vite-plugin/` | npm |
| `@miden-sdk/node-{darwin-arm64,darwin-x64,linux-x64-gnu}` | `packages/node-sdk-*` | npm (platform-specific native binaries; consumed via `optionalDependencies` on `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk`) |
| `miden-idxdb-store` | `crates/idxdb-store/` | crates.io |

The `Cargo.toml` workspace dep `miden-client = "x.y.z"` pins compatibility with the upstream Rust crate. Changes to shared types (Account, Note, gRPC schema, …) usually need a coordinated PR in `0xMiden/miden-client` first.

## Toolchain

- **Package manager**: pnpm 9 (workspace at `pnpm-workspace.yaml`). **Never** use `yarn` or `npm install` — they will desync the lockfile.
- **Node**: ≥ 20 (`engines.node` in `package.json`, `.nvmrc`).
- **Rust**: stable 1.93 + nightly (for `cargo +nightly fmt`, `clippy`, and `fix`). Pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- **Lefthook** runs pre-commit; `pnpm install` wires it via the `prepare` script.

## Build / lint / test

Drive everything through the `Makefile` — never call `cargo fmt` directly (the project requires nightly + an exact prettier/eslint pass that vanilla `cargo fmt` skips).

```bash
make help                          # list targets

# Build
make build-wasm                    # WASM crates only (wasm32-unknown-unknown)
make build-web-client              # WASM + JS bindings + dist
make build-react-sdk               # everything @miden-sdk/react needs

# Lint + format
make format                        # nightly cargo fmt + prettier write + eslint --fix
make format-check                  # CI form (no writes)
make clippy-wasm                   # clippy for both WASM crates
make typos-check                   # spellcheck
make lint                          # umbrella: fix-wasm + format + clippy-wasm + typos + checks
make web-client-check-methods      # verifies every WASM method is classified in the JS proxy

# Test
make test-coverage                 # all coverage gates (react-sdk + idxdb-store + vite-plugin + web-client unit)
make test-react-sdk                # vitest unit (jsdom)
make test-web-client-unit          # vitest unit (web-client)
make integration-test-web-client   # playwright (chromium); accepts SHARD_PARAMETER
make integration-test-web-client-webkit
```

CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs all of the above on every PR. `main` and `next` warm sccache + Swatinem/rust-cache.

## Coverage thresholds

`packages/react-sdk/vitest.config.ts` enforces `lines / branches / functions / statements ≥ 95`. Two files are excluded because they require the real WASM binary and are covered by Playwright integration tests:

- `src/utils/accountBech32.ts` — covered by `test/accountBech32.test.ts`
- `src/hooks/useAssetMetadata.ts` — covered by `test/useAssetMetadata.test.ts`

**Always run `make test-react-sdk` locally before pushing** — CI will block the merge if any threshold dips. Lowering thresholds is not the right fix; either add tests or move the file to the excluded list with justification.

## WASM concurrency: `runExclusive`

The wasm-bindgen `WebClient` is **not** safe under concurrent access. Calls that go through it from multiple call sites must serialize via the AsyncLock exposed by `MidenProvider`:

```ts
const { runExclusive } = useMiden();
await runExclusive(async (client) => { /* … */ });
```

Symptom of a violation: `Error: recursive use of an object detected which would lead to unsafe aliasing in rust`. The `crates/web-client/test/sync_lock.test.ts` integration test guards against regressions — if you add a hook that touches the client, route it through `runExclusive` (or one of the existing serialized helpers) or the lock test will fail.

## Eager vs lazy entry points

`@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` ships two entry points with identical APIs but different init behaviour:

| Specifier | When WASM loads | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` | At import (top-level await) | Vite/Webpack browser bundles where TLA is fine |
| `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk/lazy` | On first `await MidenClient.ready()` (or first awaited SDK method) | SSR (Next.js, Remix, SvelteKit), Capacitor WKWebView hosts, anywhere TLA is unsafe |

Same split applies to `@miden-sdk/react` (`react/lazy` pulls `miden-sdk/lazy`). The eager/lazy contract is guarded by `crates/web-client/test/eager_entry.test.ts` — if you change the public API in one entry, mirror it in the other and re-run the type-check scripts under `crates/web-client/scripts/`.

## Releases

Two long-lived branches:

- **`main`** → npm `latest` dist-tag. Released on GitHub release events.
- **`next`** → npm `next` dist-tag. Released when a PR merges into `next` carrying the `patch release` label.

Both branches have protection enabled; required status checks mirror across the two.

The release-publish gate compares the local `package.json` version against the **npm registry** (not against the previous git commit) — see `scripts/check-{web-client,react-sdk,vite-plugin}-version-release.sh`. So a release tag publishes whichever of the four packages have versions not yet on npm; bumping a single package is a clean release of just that one.

WASM size is gated at 25 MB in the publish workflow — if `wasm-opt` ever silently fails, the bloated binary never reaches npm.

Crate publishing (`miden-idxdb-store`, `miden-client-web`) goes through `.github/workflows/publish-crates-release.yml` and uses the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` org secret.

## Gotchas worth remembering

- **No yarn.** The repo migrated from yarn to pnpm. If you see a doc, comment, or script that says `yarn ...`, it's stale — fix it (or flag it).
- **Don't chain `pnpm --filter ... -- arg` through npm-script `&&`.** pnpm's argument forwarding only wires through to the LAST command in the chain. The Makefile splits multi-step playwright invocations across explicit Make recipes for this reason; preserve that pattern (see `integration-test-web-client` in `Makefile`).
- **Test sharding is manually balanced.** `packages/react-sdk/playwright.config.ts` defines four CI shard projects (`ci-shard-1` … `ci-shard-4`) with explicit `testMatch` arrays sized empirically from observed run timings. Rebalance by moving file paths between arrays — no workflow edits needed. Comment block at the top of the config explains the history.
- **Network-bound tests don't belong in CI.** Anything that hits a live RPC node (testnet/devnet) is excluded. If you add such a test, gate it on an env var and skip by default.
- **Account ID display.** Hooks accept hex (`0x…`) and bech32 (`mtst1q…`) interchangeably. Bech32 prefix tracks the active network — `mtst1` for testnet/devnet, `mid1` for mainnet (when it lands). Don't hardcode prefixes.
- **Code comments describe current state, not history.** Don't reference PR review threads, "earlier revisions", "per review feedback", or links to specific comment IDs in source comments — that context rots the moment the PR merges or the thread resolves. State the present-tense rationale a future reader needs ("X is gated behind `testing` so it doesn't ship in production WASM bundles"), and leave the historical "why we changed it" to the commit message and PR description.

## Cross-repo coordination

| Concern | Repo |
|---|---|
| Shared Rust types, gRPC schema, `MidenClient` semantics | [`0xMiden/miden-client`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client) |
| Account compiler, MASM standard library, base protocol types | [`0xMiden/miden-base`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-base) |
| MidenFi browser-extension wallet adapter | [`0xMiden/miden-wallet-adapter`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-wallet-adapter) |
| Para signer integration | [`0xMiden/miden-para`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-para) |
| Turnkey signer integration | [`0xMiden/miden-turnkey`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-turnkey) |

PRs that touch the WASM/JS boundary often need a synchronized PR in miden-client — bump the workspace dep and verify the integration tests still pass.

### Linking a web-sdk PR to an in-flight miden-client PR

**ALWAYS use the `Client PR: #N` marker when opening a web-sdk PR that depends on an unmerged / unreleased miden-client change.** It is the load-bearing machine-readable handle — prose mentions ("Companion PR: miden-client#N", "depends on …") do NOT trigger the linked-PR pipeline. Put the marker on its own line in the PR description (top or bottom both fine). Both `Client PR: #N` and `Client PR: 0xMiden/miden-client#N` are accepted; cross-repo is required when the linked PR comes from a fork.

When a web-sdk PR depends on Rust changes that haven't been released yet (i.e. the upstream PR on miden-client is still open), add a marker line to the web-sdk PR description:

```
Client PR: #2080
```
or, for forks / cross-repo,
```
Client PR: 0xMiden/miden-client#2080
```

CI picks up the marker via `.github/actions/inject-linked-client-pr`, appends a `[patch]` block to `Cargo.toml` (runner-local — never committed) pointing the workspace `miden-client` dep at the linked PR's head, refreshes `Cargo.lock`, and posts a sticky comment on the web-sdk PR summarizing what was patched. There is at most one such comment per PR (the action deletes it if the marker is later removed).

Local-dev parity:

```bash
# Apply the same patch to your working tree (reads the marker from the current branch's PR body):
scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh

# Or pass an explicit number / cross-repo target:
scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh 2080
scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh koookxbt/miden-client#1965

# Strip the patch before committing:
scripts/dev-with-client-pr.sh --clear
```

The script writes a marker-wrapped `[patch]` block at the bottom of `Cargo.toml`. A pre-commit hook (`lefthook.yml`) blocks any commit while the markers are present, so you can't ship the local override by accident.

**Mergeability gate.** A separate workflow (`.github/workflows/check-linked-client-pr.yml`) keeps a `linked-client-pr-ready` check on the PR. It stays *pending* while the linked client PR isn't merged-and-reachable from web-sdk's target branch's canonical refs (miden-client `next` for `next`-targeted PRs, or the latest miden-client release tag for `main`-targeted PRs). It re-evaluates every 15 minutes, so the check goes green automatically once upstream catches up — no need to push to the PR. Configure branch protection to require this check before merge.

## Documenting public-API changes

Any change that adds, renames, removes, or alters the observable behavior of a method, type, hook, option field, or return shape on either the `MidenClient` resource surface or `@miden-sdk/react` is a public-API change. Document it in **all** of the surfaces below before merging — the surfaces aren't redundant; each one is read at a different moment in the consumer's workflow (CHANGELOG at upgrade time, narrative docs / README when learning, JSDoc in the IDE, typedoc on the API-reference site).

### Where the docs are published

| Surface | URL | How it's built |
|---|---|---|
| **Narrative docs (canonical user-facing site)** | `https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/tools/clients/web-client/` (MidenClient) and `/builder/tools/clients/react-sdk/` (React SDK) | Docusaurus site at [`0xMiden/miden-docs`](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-docs). The `deploy-docs.yml` workflow there vendors each upstream repo and copies a designated docs subtree (`docs/external/src/*`) into `docs/builder/<repo>/`. |
| **API reference (typedoc)** | Same site, deeper paths | `crates/web-client/typedoc.json` declares `out: ../../docs/typedoc/web-client`. Generated by `pnpm --filter @miden-sdk/miden-sdk run typedoc` from the curated [`docs-entry.d.ts`](crates/web-client/js/types/docs-entry.d.ts) entry point. |
| **CHANGELOG (upgrade-time reading)** | Root `CHANGELOG.md` — read by dApp authors at upgrade time. | Hand-written. CI ingestion is per-repo: don't expect this file to be aggregated elsewhere. |
| **READMEs (npm landing page)** | `crates/web-client/README.md` and `packages/react-sdk/README.md` are what npm users see on the package page. | Hand-written. Keep narrative aligned with the published Docusaurus site — they share content but the README has the wider audience for first-touch. |

### Source-of-truth for the published narrative docs

The Docusaurus site at miden-docs ingests **`docs/external/src/`** from each upstream repo and copies the contents into `docs/builder/<repo>/`. After the web/WASM split (PR [#1992](https://github.com/0xMiden/miden-client/pull/1992)) miden-client's `docs/external/src/` now contains only Rust-client material; the **MidenClient resource API and React SDK narrative docs need to live in this repo's `docs/external/src/`** and be wired into the deploy-docs workflow. The expected layout (mirrors what miden-client used to ship):

```
docs/external/src/
├── _category_.yml
├── index.md                          # Builder → Client landing
├── web-client/                       # @miden-sdk/miden-sdk
│   ├── _category_.yml
│   ├── get-started/                  # install, quick start, send/receive, custom signer
│   ├── library/                      # accounts, notes, transactions, sync, prover, compile
│   └── examples.md
└── react-client/                     # @miden-sdk/react
    ├── _category_.yml
    ├── get-started/
    └── library/                      # accounts, notes, provider, hooks ...
```

If your change adds a public capability and `docs/external/src/` doesn't exist yet (or the relevant subdir is missing), **create the page as part of the same PR**. Don't ship a feature whose only narrative documentation is the README — the README is reference, the Docusaurus page is where consumers actually learn the workflow.

### Typedoc — regenerated by CI, don't commit

`docs/typedoc/web-client/` is **build output**, not source. CI regenerates it fresh on every run via `pnpm --filter @miden-sdk/miden-sdk run typedoc`, fed by the curated [`crates/web-client/js/types/docs-entry.d.ts`](crates/web-client/js/types/docs-entry.d.ts) entry point (which re-exports `api-types.d.ts` wholesale plus selected WASM classes). The directory is `.gitignore`d.

The `Check that web client documentation is up-to-date` step in `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `git diff --exit-code` over the regenerated tree. With the dir untracked the diff is empty — the step is a **warning-only smoke test** that surfaces typedoc's own warnings during the run. It does not gate merge.

What this means in practice: keep your JSDoc on `api-types.d.ts` accurate (that's where typedoc reads from), and don't worry about regenerating docs locally. The published API reference picks up the next typedoc run when the docs site rebuilds.

### MidenClient surface — `crates/web-client/`

| Surface | What goes there | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `crates/web-client/js/types/api-types.d.ts` | TS declaration with full JSDoc on every method, option field, and return shape. Discriminated unions for option variants. The JSDoc IS the typedoc source — be thorough here. | Any addition/change to a `*Resource` interface, `MidenClient` class, or supporting option/result type. |
| `crates/web-client/js/resources/<area>.js` | JSDoc comment on the impl method explaining behavior, inputs, return value, and any non-obvious invariants (locking, atomicity, polling semantics). | Any new method or behavioral change on a resource impl. |
| `crates/web-client/js/types/docs-entry.d.ts` | Add the type to the curated re-exports if it should appear on the typedoc-generated API reference. `api-types` is already re-exported wholesale; only WASM-side classes need explicit listing. | New WASM class becomes part of the public surface. |
| `docs/typedoc/web-client/` (generated, gitignored) | **Don't commit.** Regenerated by CI; the in-repo CI verification step is warning-only. Just keep the JSDoc on `api-types.d.ts` accurate and the rendered API reference will update on the next docs build. | Always covered automatically once the JSDoc is right. |
| `docs/external/src/web-client/` | Narrative Docusaurus page under `library/` (concept reference) or `get-started/` (workflow). Show the happy path; cross-reference singular siblings. Mention V1 constraints if they're non-obvious (single-account, no per-tx ids, etc.). | New high-level capability that a dApp author would reach for. |
| `crates/web-client/README.md` → `## Usage` | Same narrative as the Docusaurus page, condensed. The README is what npm users see on the package landing page. | Same as above. Keep aligned with the Docusaurus copy. |
| Root `CHANGELOG.md` | One bullet under `## <next-version> (TBD)` → `### Enhancements` (or `### Fixes` / `### Breaking`). Prefix tags: `[FEATURE][web]` for web-only, `[FEATURE][rust,cli,web]` for cross-cutting. Include the *smallest* example or method shape, link the PR (`web-sdk#NN`) and any companion miden-client PR. Don't repeat README copy verbatim — the audience is a consumer who's about to upgrade. **NEVER add an entry to a section whose version has already been published — check `gh api repos/0xMiden/web-sdk/releases/latest` for the latest tag and put new entries under a section whose version is strictly higher and still has `(TBA)` / `(TBD)` next to it. If no such section exists, add one.** The header at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` may lag (a `(TBA)` heading often persists after the release tags out); don't trust the heading alone. | Any user-visible API addition, behavior change, or fix. |

### React SDK surface — `packages/react-sdk/`

| Surface | What goes there | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/react-sdk/src/hooks/<hook>.ts` | JSDoc on the hook export covering the returned object shape (`{action, result, isLoading, stage, error, reset}` for mutations; `{...data, isLoading, error, refetch}` for queries), accepted args, side effects, and concurrency guards. | New hook or change to an existing hook's signature/return. |
| `packages/react-sdk/src/types/*` | TS declarations for any new option/result types the hook surfaces. Mirror the discriminated-union conventions used in the WebClient surface. | New public type emerging from a hook. |
| `docs/external/src/react-client/` | Narrative Docusaurus page (per-hook or per-pattern). The hub is `library/`, deep-link individual hooks under `library/<group>/`. | New hook, new pattern, or changed semantics worth a code example. |
| `packages/react-sdk/CLAUDE.md` | Per-package hook-by-hook usage guide. Add a fenced code block under the right section (`## Reading Data`, `## Writing Data`, `## Common Patterns`, `## External Signer Integration`). Show realistic usage, not just the signature. **Mirror the Docusaurus content** — same examples, same prose, this is the npm-landing version. | Same as above. |
| `packages/react-sdk/README.md` → `## Features` | One bullet on the high-level feature list if it's a notable addition (new hook category, new integration). Subordinate hook tweaks don't go here. | A reader scanning the README would want to know this exists. |
| Root `CHANGELOG.md` | One bullet, same format as above, prefixed `[FEATURE][react]` (or `[FIX][react]`, `[BREAKING][react]`). | Any user-visible hook/provider/util change. |

### Conventions

- **Match existing tone.** Look at adjacent README/CHANGELOG/Docusaurus entries before writing — they're terse, imperative, and lead with what the consumer can now *do*. Avoid implementation chatter ("we now do X internally") unless it's a behavioral signal that affects how the consumer writes code.
- **Don't write speculative docs.** If the API is part-implemented (e.g. V1 today, V2 planned), document V1 only and call out the constraint inline. The next PR can extend the doc when V2 lands.
- **Cross-link the PRs.** Every CHANGELOG entry needs the PR link at the end. If the change required a coordinated miden-client PR, link both — the consumer's mental model spans both repos.
- **One source of truth per fact.** A V1 constraint ("single-account batch") goes in the Docusaurus narrative *and* the JSDoc. The CHANGELOG mentions it once. Don't repeat the full constraint list across files; cross-reference if it gets long.
- **README ⇄ Docusaurus parity.** READMEs are the npm landing page; Docusaurus is the canonical site. Keep the narrative aligned. If they diverge, the Docusaurus page is the source of truth — fix the README to match.
- **Don't commit typedoc.** `docs/typedoc/web-client/` is build output, regenerated fresh on every CI run. The in-repo verification step is warning-only. Keep JSDoc on `api-types.d.ts` accurate; the rendered API reference picks up changes automatically.
- **Update before commit.** Pre-commit hooks don't enforce doc parity, but reviewers will. Mention "docs updated" in the PR description so reviewers know where to look.

### Doc-only PRs

If you find a stale doc (e.g. the API changed but the Docusaurus page or README didn't), fix it as a separate `docs:`-prefixed commit on the same branch — keeps diffs reviewable. The CHANGELOG `no changelog` label exists for these.

When fixing a stale Docusaurus page that lives downstream at `0xMiden/miden-docs`, push the upstream fix here in `docs/external/src/` and let the next deploy-docs run pick it up; don't edit the Docusaurus repo directly for content that's supposed to be ingested from this repo.

## Contributing checklist

1. `make lint` clean.
2. `make test-coverage` clean (and locally verify thresholds before pushing).
3. For changes to public API: every doc surface in the [Documenting public-API changes](#documenting-public-api-changes) section above. Specifically: JSDoc on `api-types.d.ts` + the resource impl, narrative pages under `docs/external/src/`, READMEs, root `CHANGELOG.md`. (`docs/typedoc/web-client/` is regenerated by CI — don't commit it.) The type-check scripts under `crates/web-client/scripts/` may also need updating if you added a forwarder or new method classification.
4. For changes to release flow: cross-check both `publish-web-client-release.yml` (latest channel) and `publish-web-client-next.yml` (next channel) — they intentionally mirror each other.
